# DiffPrivateModelEval: An R Package for Differentially Private Model Evaluation
This repository contains an R package designed to facilitate the evaluation of reinforcement learning algorithms with differential privacy guarantees. 
The package provides seamless integration with Python-based algorithms using the reticulate package, robust visualization tools for cumulative regret analysis, 
and easy-to-use wrapper functions for algorithms like DP-LSVI-Ngo, DP-LSVI-UCB++, and more.
